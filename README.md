This example will illustrate Clean DDD concepts on a familiar example using the latest technologies from Spring Boot
ecosystem.

- Use case centric approach

In this project I'll try to use AI search/agents as much as possible. The idea being to learn how to use them
effectively on realistic example. Here are the tools I'll use mostly:

- perplexity.io
- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)
- Claude AI
- Copilot IntelliJ plugin with Gemini 2.5 Flush Preview and Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Gemini Cli with Gemini 2.5 Pro

I'm using Bootstrap in the UI. Here are sources, links and attributions for the code snippets which I'm using:
