Pet Store with Clean DDD
---

This example will illustrate Clean DDD concepts on a familiar example using the latest technologies from Spring Boot
ecosystem.

- Use case centric approach
- UI is based on Thymeleaf with htmx
- Clean separation of Controllers and Presenters
- Evolutive architecture with Flyway DB migrations

### DISCLAIMER

In this project I'll try to use AI search/agents as much as possible. The idea being to learn how to use them
effectively on realistic example. Here are the tools I'll use mostly:

- perplexity.io
- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Anthropic)
